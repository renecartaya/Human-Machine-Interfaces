##Real-Time Data Acquisition and Instrumentation Firmware

###Description

This script is part of a real-time data acquisition and instrumentation project, designed to facilitate high-speed data acquisition from various sensors and instruments. The firmware is optimized for embedded systems and microcontrollers, allowing real-time processing and data capture for a wide range of applications.

###Features

Real-time data acquisition from multiple sensors and instruments.
Support for high-speed data sampling and precise timing synchronization.
Configurable data acquisition parameters (sampling rate, resolution, etc.).
Seamless integration with various communication protocols (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C).
Low-latency processing for immediate data feedback and analysis.
Scalable and efficient design for resource-constrained embedded systems.
Easily extendable and customizable for specific sensor and instrument interfaces.

###Prerequisites

[List any hardware requirements]
[List any software dependencies]

###Installation

###Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/renecartaya/Instrumentation.git


###Usage

The firmware could be implemented using Arduino, for that you can load using the standard Arduino procedure

The project could be implemented as solution for DAQ for general or specific purposes, for example, alongside Faraday cups for ion counting.
